# Serie A Telegram Bot

A Telegram bot designed for Serie A and Fantacalcio enthusiasts.
It automatically sends a reminder 30 minutes before the first match of every Serie A matchday, ensuring that participants remember to submit their lineup on time.

The bot operates completely autonomously: once a matchday ends, it identifies the next one and schedules the upcoming reminder without any manual action.
In addition to notifications, the bot now offers useful interactive commands, allowing users to check the status of the next matchday and reminder time, view the full Serie A standings, and request the match schedule of any gameweek simply by typing /partiteX (for example, /partite10 to see matchday 10 fixtures).
A dedicated /comandi menu is also available, displaying all supported commands in a convenient format.

This project is actively maintained and continuously evolving, with new features and improvements being introduced on a regular basis.
